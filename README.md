# CPSC531_OnTheHoofDairy

On The Hoof dairy is an agriculture business that needs an information system to track the efficiency and production of an individual cow. The efficiency of an individual cow depends on various factors, such as the fodder's nutrition content and the cow's genes, that will aid in tracking the amount of milk produced by the cow. The system aims to record the above data for making intelligent business decisions, like budgeting the cost for fodder and medical treatment, to determine the value of the cow. By tracking the births and the resulting genealogy, the company can compute the average milk production of a given cow to see how production capability is passed genetically.
